      <div id='bio'>
        named by The Pocatello Sun as one of the top 10 most promising bands in Idaho, seagullz's music combines pop, chill, and hip-hop in a unique mix filled with heart. <br><br>
        growing up in the small town of Rigby, aspiring musicians Willy Eilish and Post Bologne could only dream of what the ocean was like.
        now, joined by rapper Lil Idaho and saxophonist Cardi C, their band is well on their way to seeing their dream come true; in just a few years, they will embark on a tour that will take them all the way to the coasts of Portland, Washington.
